    <h1><strong>V IS NOT A BAD CHARACTER</strong></h1> <br>
    <p>He's really fun</p> <br>
    <p>Yeah he's physically weak but he has FUCKIN FAMILIARS</p> <br>
    <p>They give you easy SSS ranks</p> <br>
    <p>You literally just sit there and read a book while your animals kill everything</p> <br>
    <p>It's awesome</p> <br>
    <p>Yeah</p> <br>
    <p>OK SURE HE'S A LITTLE JANKY</p> <br>
    <p>BUT HE'S FUN DESPITE THE JANK</p> <br>
    <p>L + ratio + V sweep + every other character is mid</p> <br>
   <p>Nero is just dante but worse</p> <br>
    <p>I haven't actually played Vergil yet</p> <br>
